# Enigma
Enigma - cryptographic program of password, text or message
•	With this program, the user can encrypt or decrypt a password, text or message.
•	The program uses C++ or Java. The user inputs a text and then a key and a style of encryption. 
The key is formed by numbers bigger than 3 digits. To encrypt each character of the initial text 
the program uses its representation in ASCII and then encrypted using the key and the style of encryption. 
At the end of encryption, the text will be an array of numbers. For decryption, the user inputs the encrypted 
message then applies the key and the style used for encryption. In the end, the user will see the initial message decrypted.
